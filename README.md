# chordpro-ft-vim

chordpro-ft-vim is a filetype plugin for Vim or Neovim.
It offers convenient methods for editing [ChordPro](https://chordpro.org) files.

If you're looking for syntax highlighting for your ChordPro files,
check out [vim-scripts/chordpro.vim](https://github.com/vim-scripts/chordpro.vim), which is recommended.


## Installation

Installation is easy using your preferred plugin manager.


### Example using vim-plug

Add the following to your `vimrc` or `init.vim`:

    Plug 'TexTerry/chordpro-ft-vim'

To install the plugin, run:

    :PlugInstall

## Usage

chordpro-ft-vim offers a number of new commands and key mappings that simplify
the editing of ChordPro files â€“ for example, inserting chords or managing
metadata.

All key mappings use `<localleader>`. You need to define a localleader in your
`vimrc` or `init.vim` file:

    let maplocalleader = ",,"

This sets the localleader to ",,". Change the keys to your liking.

### Commands in normal mode

The following commands have been implemented so far. 
This project is still in its infancy, so the naming or key mapping will 
certainly change in the future.
